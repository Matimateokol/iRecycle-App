## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_. Initially it was a project which was being prepared for Enactus Poland 2020. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and the competition being canceled I and my friends abandoned the project as the main motivation and objective hadn't could be met.


## Room for Improvement
These are areas I believe need improvement / could be improved. Also I included TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:

- Build an alpha android version app.

To do:
- Add navigation bar.
- Implement AI Image recognition module.
